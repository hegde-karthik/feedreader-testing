# Project Overview

* In this project a web-based application is tested that reads RSS feeds. 
* The testing of website is done using the jasmine library.
* Different test suites and test cases are written to test out the different aspects of the website.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

## How to run?

* Clone or download the project repository into your system.
* open the index.html file to open the website.
* Once the website loads,at the bottom of the page the deatils of the test suits and test cases are displayed.
